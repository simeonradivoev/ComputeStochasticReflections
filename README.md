# Features
* Hierarchical Z-depth casting
* Temporal reflection depth reprojection
* Median Filtering for extra denoising
* Reflection Color Mipmap Pyramid
* Raycast and resolve pass downsampling
* Frame reprojection for faking multiple bounces
* Specular elongation
* Contact hardening

# Requirements
* Works only with deferred rendering
* Compute shader capable video card
* [Unity Post Processing v2](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing)
* Tested with Unity 2018.2

# Installation
In a unity project go to your `Packages` folder. Open `manifest.json` and add into the dependencies the following line: 

```
"com.simeonradivoev.stochastic-reflections": "https://github.com/simeonradivoev/ComputeStochasticReflections.git"
```

It should look something like this:

```
{
    "dependencies": {
        "com.unity.ugui": "1.0.0",
        "com.unity.modules.ui": "1.0.0",
        "com.simeonradivoev.stochastic-reflections": "https://github.com/simeonradivoev/ComputeStochasticReflections.git",
    } 
}
```

# Usage
Just add a new effect in a post processing profile under `Custom/Stochastic Screen Space Reflections`
For VR use the test branch called `StereoRendering`. It currently only supports multi pass rendering.
